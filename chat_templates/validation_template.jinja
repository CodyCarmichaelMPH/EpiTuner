**Classification Validation Task**

You are a senior medical coder reviewing classifications made by a junior coder. Your task is to validate the classification and rationale for accuracy and completeness.

**Classification Criteria:** {{ classification_topic }}

**Medical Record:**
{{ medical_record }}

**Original Classification:**
- Classification: {{ original_classification }}
- Confidence: {{ original_confidence }}
- Rationale: {{ original_rationale }}

**Validation Instructions:**
1. Review the medical record carefully
2. Evaluate the original classification for accuracy
3. Assess the rationale for completeness and evidence-based reasoning
4. Determine if the classification should be:
   - **ACCEPTED** - Classification and rationale are accurate and complete
   - **REVISED** - Classification is correct but rationale needs improvement
   - **REDO** - Classification is incorrect or rationale is fundamentally flawed

**Your Response:**
1. **Validation Decision:** [ACCEPTED/REVISED/REDO]
2. **Reasoning:** [Explain why you made this decision]
3. **If REVISED/REDO, provide improved classification:**
   - **Classification:** [Match/Not a Match/Unknown]
   - **Confidence:** [Very Confident/Confident/Somewhat Confident/Not Very Confident/Not at all Confident]
   - **Rationale:** [Provide a detailed, evidence-based explanation that includes:
     - Key medical indicators from the record that support your classification
     - Specific symptoms, diagnoses, or demographic factors that align with the criteria
     - Any conflicting or ambiguous information that influenced your decision
     - Clinical reasoning for why this case does or does not meet the classification criteria
     - Reference to specific sections of the medical record]
